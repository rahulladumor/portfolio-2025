          Currently leading CodeLamda Technologies, where we're revolutionizing cloud solutions and AI implementation

          My expertise spans across Cloud Architecture (AWS, Azure, GCP), AI/ML Solutions (TensorFlow, PyTorch, SageMaker),
          and Full Stack Development (Node.js, Python, Golang). I'm particularly passionate about serverless architectures,
          blockchain technologies, and enterprise-grade AI implementations.

          strategic business thinking. I've successfully led teams in developing innovative solutions across cybersecurity,
          AI-powered platforms, and enterprise systems.

        <p>
          Beyond technology, I'm committed to fostering tech education and community building in Gujarat, helping
          bridge the digital divide through workshops and mentoring programs. I regularly contribute to the developer
